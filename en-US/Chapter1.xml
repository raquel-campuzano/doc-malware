	that go beyond signature-based policies and the like. </para>
	<para>Thanks to reputation tools and the use of sandboxing, we can obtain a broader analysis and the possibility to rate files, emails, IP addresses and URL addresses with the objective of
	protecting the devices that make up its network infrastructure.</para>
	<para>For file capturing and threat detection, redborder Malware is supported by the use of different sensors that are able to block the entry of files with bad reputations in real time. Furthermore, 
	an agent has been developed for specific versions of the Microsoft Windows operating system to increase the local detection of Commitment Indicators which can be used for the forensic analysis.
	These are the elements that make of the redborder Malware scenario:</para>
